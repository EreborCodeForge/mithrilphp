# MithrilPHP

**MithrilPHP** is a lightweight and resilient PHP engine designed to silently protect applications.  
Invisible by design, it provides a solid runtime foundation without imposing architectural decisions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

MithrilPHP exists to be the **engine behind frameworks**, not the framework itself.

It provides the essential building blocks required to execute applications reliably, while remaining lightweight, explicit, and opinion-free.

---

## 🛡️ Design Philosophy

Inspired by the Mithril worn by Frodo, MithrilPHP follows a simple principle:

> **You should not feel it — until it saves you.**

- The core protects execution, not business logic  
- The domain remains sovereign  
- The engine absorbs impact without dictating structure  

---

## ⚙️ What MithrilPHP Is

- A **core runtime engine**
- A foundation for frameworks
- A silent execution layer
- A console and HTTP backbone

---

## ❌ What MithrilPHP Is Not

- A full framework  
- A project skeleton  
- An MVC solution  
- A DDD or Clean Architecture implementation  

Those responsibilities belong to **frameworks built on top of MithrilPHP**.

---

## 🔧 Core Responsibilities

- HTTP Kernel and routing execution  
- Console Kernel and command execution  
- Dependency Injection container  
- Environment variable access  
- Configuration loading  
- Low-level abstractions required by frameworks  

---

## 🪓 Ecosystem

MithrilPHP is designed to power opinionated frameworks.

The first official implementation is:

- **Durin’s Forge** — a framework that forges real applications on top of MithrilPHP  

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
composer require ereborcodeforge/mithrilphp
